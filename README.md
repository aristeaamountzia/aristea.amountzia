# Minimalistic Portfolio Website

This is a minimalistic portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is designed with a black and white theme and uses the "Impact" font for a bold, modern look.

## Structure

- **portfolio.html**: The single HTML file that includes all the necessary code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

## Categories

The portfolio website contains the following categories, each leading to a gallery of related images:
1. **Σχέδια (Designs)**
2. **Φωτογραφίες (Photos)**
3. **Βίντεο (Videos)**
4. **Κατασκευές (Constructions)**
5. **Γραφιστικά (Graphics)**

## How to Use

1. Open `portfolio.html` in a web browser to view the portfolio.
2. Click on any category to view the related gallery.

## Customization

- Add more images to the `/images` folder under the appropriate subfolder.
- Update the JavaScript in the `portfolio.html` file if you add new categories or images.

## Notes

- Ensure that the images are placed in the correct folders under `/images`.
- The website uses a minimalistic design, so feel free to customize the CSS to match your style.
